# Encoding large information structures in linear algebra

An experiment is shown with a linear mixed model. In genetics, a Genetic Relatedness Matrix is used as the covariance structure for the random effects. With encoding of the sample information, the sample structure of this covariance matrix can be reduced from (N samples) to (M samples) where (N > M).

This is for 100 permutation runs of a simulation with 1000 samples and 100 SNPs simulated according to:
